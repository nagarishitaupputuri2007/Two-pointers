 Two-Pointer Array Merger

Description
This is a Python implementation of the two-pointer technique to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array efficiently. The two-pointer method is often used in problems that involve linear traversal of two arrays, making it optimal for tasks like merging.

The script:

Accepts two sorted arrays as input.

Merges them into a single sorted array using a linear time algorithm.

Outputs the merged array.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Takes input for the size and elements of the first and second arrays.

Uses two pointers (i and j) to traverse both arrays.

At each step, compares the current elements and appends the smaller one to the result.

Continues until all elements from both arrays are merged.

ðŸš€ Example
Input:

Copy
Edit
4  
1 3 5 7  
3  
2 4 6
Output:

Copy
Edit
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
